/**
 * Extends some classes from {@link org.apache.sis.metadata.iso} packages in order to give them
 * the name used by imagery extensions (ISO 19115-2). This is required for XML (un)marshalling
 * because GeoAPI merged some classes which were dissociated in the ISO specifications.
 * The GeoAPI merge were done in order to simplify the conceptual model for developers,
 * since the classes were different in ISO specifications for historical reasons - not
 * conceptual reasons.
 *
 * <p>In SIS implementation, users need to care only about the public classes defined in
 * the {@link org.apache.sis.metadata.iso} package. When marshalling, the adapters will
 * inspect the properties that are ISO 19115-2 extensions and copy automatically the
 * {@code "gmd"} metadata into a {@code "gmi"} metadata if any ISO 19115-2 property is
 * non-null or non-empty. This work is performed by a {@code castOrCopy} static method
 * defined in each class of this package.</p>
