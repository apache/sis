/**
 * A guard against infinite recursivity in {@link AbstractMetadata#hashCode()},
 * {@link AbstractMetadata#isEmpty()} and {@link ModifiableMetadata#prune()} methods.
 * {@link AbstractMetadata#equals(Object)} uses an other implementation in {@link ObjectPair}.
 *
 * <div class="section">The problem</div>
 * Cyclic associations can exist in ISO 19115 metadata. For example {@code Instrument} know the platform
 * it is mounted on, and the {@code Platform} know its list of instrument. Consequently walking down the
 * metadata tree can cause infinite recursivity, unless we keep trace of previously visited metadata objects
 * in order to avoid visiting them again. We use an {@link IdentityHashMap} for that purpose, since the
 * recursivity problem exists only when revisiting the exact same instance. Furthermore, {@code HashMap}
 * would not suit since it invokes {@code equals(Object)} and {@code hashCode()}, which are precisely
 * the methods that we want to avoid invoking twice.
 *
 * @param  <V>  the kind of values to store in the maps.
