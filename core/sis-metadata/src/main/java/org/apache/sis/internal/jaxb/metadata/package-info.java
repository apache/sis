/**
 * JAXB adapters for metadata. The class defined in this package are both JAXB adapters
 * replacing GeoAPI interfaces by SIS implementation classes at marshalling time (since
 * JAXB can not marshall directly interfaces), and wrappers around the value to be marshalled.
 * ISO 19139 have the strange habit to wrap every properties in an extra level, for example:
 *
 * {@preformat xml
 *   <CI_ResponsibleParty>
 *     <contactInfo>
 *       <CI_Contact>
 *         ...
 *       </CI_Contact>
 *     </contactInfo>
 *   </CI_ResponsibleParty>
 * }
 *
 * The {@code </CI_Contact>} level is not really necessary, and JAXB is not designed for inserting
 * such level since it is not the usual way to write XML. In order to get this output with JAXB, we
 * have to wrap metadata object in an additional object. Those additional objects are defined in
 * this package.
 *
 * <p>So each class in this package is both a JAXB adapter and a wrapper. We have merged those
 * functionalities in order to avoid doubling the amount of classes, which is already large.</p>
 *
 * <p>In ISO 19139 terminology:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the public classes defined in the {@code org.apache.sis.metadata.iso} packages are defined
 *       as {@code Foo_Type} in ISO 19139, where <var>Foo</var> is the ISO name of a class.</li>
 *   <li>the internal classes defined in this package are defined as {@code Foo_PropertyType} in
 *       ISO 19139 schemas.</li>
 * </ul>
