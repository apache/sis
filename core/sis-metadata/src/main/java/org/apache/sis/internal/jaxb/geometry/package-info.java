/**
 * JAXB adapters for geometries.
 * This package regroups all adapters mapping GeoAPI interfaces to their SIS
 * implementation. We must use adapters since JAXB can not annotate interfaces.
 * Consequently the purpose of these adapters is to replace interfaces.
 *
 * <p>Every time JAXB tries to marshall or unmarshall an interface, the adapter
 * will be substituted to that interface.</p>
