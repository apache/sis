IllegalGridCoordinate_1           = \u201c{0}\u201d is not a valid grid coordinate.
IllegalLatitudeBand_1             = \u201c{0}\u201d is not a valid latitude band. A letter was expected.
IllegalSquareIdentification_1     = \u201c{0}\u201d is not a valid square identification.
IllegalUPSZone_1                  = \u201c{0}\u201d is not a valid Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS) zone.
IllegalUTMZone_1                  = \u201c{0}\u201d is not a valid Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone.
InconsistentWithGZD_2             = Square identification in the \u201c{0}\u201d reference is inconsistent with the grid zone designation. A consistent zone would be \u201c{1}\u201d.
LocationTypeCycle_1               = Location type \u201c{0}\u201d can not have itself as a children.
LocationTypeNotFound_1            = No location type named \u201c{0}\u201d has been found.
OddGridCoordinateLength_1         = Can not determine dimension of \u201c{0}\u201d because of odd number of characters.
ParentAlreadyExists_1             = A location type parent named \u201c{0}\u201d already exists.
ChildAlreadyExists_1              = Location type parent already has a child named \u201c{0}\u201d.
