/**
 * Thrown when a geographic identifier (or reference) has been successfully parsed but fails some verification.
 * Examples:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <cite>100â€‰000-metres square identification</cite> of a {@linkplain MilitaryGridReferenceSystem MGRS}
 *       reference is not consistent with the <cite>Grid Zone Designation</cite>.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The purpose of those verifications is to perform some error detection.
 * For example it may help to detect if a typo occurred when a user entered a coordinate manually.
