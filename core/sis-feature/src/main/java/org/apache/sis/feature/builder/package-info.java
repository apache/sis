/**
 * Helper classes for creating {@code FeatureType} instances. Usage of this package is not mandatory,
 * but make easier to create {@link org.apache.sis.feature.DefaultFeatureType} instances together with
 * their attributes and associations.
 *
 * <p>The starting point is {@link org.apache.sis.feature.builder.FeatureTypeBuilder}.
 * Example:</p>
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     // Create a feature type for a city, which contains a name and a population.
 *     FeatureTypeBuilder builder = new FeatureTypeBuilder().setName("City");
 *     builder.addAttribute(String.class).setName("name");
 *     builder.addAttribute(Integer.class).setName("population");
 *     FeatureType city = builder.build();
 *
 *     // Create a subclass for a city which is also a capital.
 *     builder = new FeatureTypeBuilder().setName("Capital").setSuperTypes(city);
 *     builder.addAttribute(String.class).setName("parliament");
 *     FeatureType capital = builder.build();
 * }
