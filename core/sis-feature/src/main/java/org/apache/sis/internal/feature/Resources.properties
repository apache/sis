CanNotInstantiateProperty_1       = Property \u201c{0}\u201d is not a type that can be instantiated.
CanNotSetCharacteristics_2        = Can not set a value of type \u2018{1}\u2019 to characteristic \u201c{0}\u201d.
CanNotSetPropertyValue_1          = Type of the \u201c{0}\u201d property does not allow to set a value.
CharacteristicsAlreadyExists_2    = Characteristics \u201c{1}\u201d already exists in attribute \u201c{0}\u201d.
CharacteristicsNotFound_2         = No characteristics named \u201c{1}\u201d has been found in \u201c{0}\u201d attribute.
DependencyNotFound_3              = Operation \u201c{0}\u201d requires a \u201c{1}\u201d property, but no such property has been found in \u201c{2}\u201d.
IllegalFeatureType_3              = Association \u201c{0}\u201d does not accept features of type \u2018{2}\u2019. Expected an instance of \u2018{1}\u2019 or derived type.
