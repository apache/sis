/**
 * Indicates the role played by the association between two features.
 * In the area of geographic information, there exist multiple kinds of associations:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Aggregation</b> represents associations between features which can exist even if the aggregate is destroyed.</li>
 *   <li><b>Composition</b> represents relationships where the owned features are destroyed together with the composite.</li>
 *   <li><b>Spatial</b> association represents spatial or topological relationships that may exist between features (e.g. “<cite>east of</cite>”).</li>
 *   <li><b>Temporal</b> association may represent for example a sequence of changes over time involving the replacement of some
 *       feature instances by other feature instances.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="section">Immutability and thread safety</div>
 * Instances of this class are immutable if all properties ({@link GenericName} and {@link InternationalString}
 * instances) and all arguments (e.g. {@code valueType}) given to the constructor are also immutable.
 * Such immutable instances can be shared by many objects and passed between threads without synchronization.
