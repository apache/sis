/**
 * Tools for SIS tests. This package defines a base class, {@link org.apache.sis.test.TestCase},
 * which is extended directly or indirectly by most (but not all) SIS tests.
 * This package defines also an {@link org.apache.sis.test.Assert} class which extend the GeoAPI
 * {@link org.opengis.test.Assert} (which itself extends the JUnit {@link org.junit.Assert} class)
 * with the addition of assertion methods commonly used in SIS tests.
 *
 * <div class="section">Outputs configuration</div>
 * By default, successful tests do not produce any output. However it is possible to ask for
 * verbose outputs, which is sometime useful for debugging purpose. This behavior is controlled
 * from the command line by defining {@linkplain java.lang.System#getProperties() system properties}
 * values like below:
 *
 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li><b>{@code -Dorg.apache.sis.test.verbose=true}</b><br>
 *     For enabling verbose outputs to the {@linkplain java.lang.System#console() console} if any,
 *     or to the {@linkplain java.lang.System#out standard output stream} otherwise.</li>
 *
 *   <li><b>{@code -Dorg.apache.sis.test.encoding=UTF-8}</b> (or any other valid encoding name)<br>
 *     For the encoding of the above-cited verbose output, and the encoding of logging messages
 *     sent to the {@linkplain java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler console handler}.
 *     This is useful on Windows or MacOS platforms having a console encoding different than the
 *     platform encoding. If omitted, then the platform encoding will be used.</li>
 * </ul>
