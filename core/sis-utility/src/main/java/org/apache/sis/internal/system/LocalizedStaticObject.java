/**
 * Annotates a static object created using the {@linkplain java.util.Locale#getDefault() default locale}
 * and {@linkplain java.util.TimeZone#getDefault() default timezone} values which existed at the object
 * creation time.
 *
 * If JDK provided listeners allowing SIS to be notified about locale and timezone changes, we would
 * reset the annotated object to {@code null}. However since those listeners do not exist as of JDK7,
 * we use this annotation in the meantime for identifying the code which would need to be revisited
 * if we want to take in account default locale/timezone changes in a future SIS version.
