/**
 * The Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78).
 * This is a dimensionless quantity for the measurement of sea water salinity.
 * In principle, the unit of measurement associated to this quantity has no symbol.
 * However Apache SIS uses the "psu" symbol for avoiding confusion with other dimensionless units.
 *
 * <p>{@code Salinity} quantities should not be converted to quantities of other types.
 * If nevertheless a conversion to {@link javax.measure.quantity.Dimensionless} is attempted,
 * then Apache SIS implementation maps 1 psu to 1â€° for approximative correspondence with legacy
 * (before 1978) salinity measurements.</p>
 *
 * <p>Most quantity types are defined in the {@link javax.measure.quantity}.
 * This {@code Salinity} type is an extension to the standard types.</p>
