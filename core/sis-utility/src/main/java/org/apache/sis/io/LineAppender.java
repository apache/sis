/**
 * An {@link Appendable} which can apply different kinds of reformatting that depend on the
 * <cite>End Of Line</cite> (EOL) occurrences. Available reformatting include inserting a
 * a margin before each line, wrapping to a maximal line length and replacing tabulations or
 * EOL characters. The actual work to be done can be enabled by invoking one or many of the
 * following methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #setMaximalLineLength(int)} for wrapping the lines to some maximal line length,
 *       typically 80 Unicode characters (code points).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #setTabulationExpanded(boolean)} for replacing tabulation characters by spaces.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #setLineSeparator(String)} for replacing all occurrences of
 *       {@linkplain Characters#isLineOrParagraphSeparator(int) line separators} by the given string.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * In addition this class removes trailing {@linkplain Character#isWhitespace(int) whitespaces}
 * before end of lines.
 *
 * <div class="section">How line lengths are calculated</div>
 * Line length are measured in unit of Unicode <cite>code points</cite>. This is usually the same
 * than the number of {@code char} primitive values, but not always. Combining characters are not
 * yet recognized by this class, but future versions may improve on that.
 *
 * <p>For proper line length calculation in presence of tabulation characters ({@code '\t'}),
 * this class needs to known the tabulation width. The default value is 8, but this can be changed
 * by a call to {@link #setTabulationWidth(int)}. Note that invoking that method affects only line
 * length calculation; it does not replace tabulations by spaces. For tabulation expansion, see
 * {@link #setTabulationExpanded(boolean)}.</p>
