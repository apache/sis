/**
 * Specifies the level of strictness when comparing two {@link LenientComparable} objects
 * for equality. This enumeration allows users to specify which kind of differences can be
 * tolerated between two objects: differences in implementation class, differences in
 * some kinds of property, or slight difference in numerical values.
 *
 * <p>This enumeration is <em>ordered</em> from stricter to more lenient levels:</p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>{@link #STRICT}          – All attributes of the compared objects shall be strictly equal.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #BY_CONTRACT}     – Only the attributes published in the interface contract need to be compared.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #IGNORE_METADATA} – Only the attributes relevant to the object functionality are compared.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #APPROXIMATIVE}   – Only the attributes relevant to the object functionality are compared,
 *                                  with some tolerance threshold on numerical values.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #ALLOW_VARIANT}   – For objects not really equal but related (e.g. CRS using different axis order).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #DEBUG}           – Special mode for figuring out why two objects expected to be equal are not.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * If two objects are equal at some level of strictness <var>E</var>, then they should also
 * be equal at all levels listed below <var>E</var> in the above list. For example if two objects
 * are equal at the {@link #BY_CONTRACT} level, then they should also be equal at the
 * {@link #IGNORE_METADATA} level but not necessarily at the {@link #STRICT} level.
