    <h1>Class ObjectIdentification</h1>
    <p>The <code>org.apache.sis.internal.jaxb.gco</code> package conceptually defines two complementary objects:
        <code>ObjectIdentification</code> and <code>ObjectReference</code>. However only the later is defined by
        a Java class, because the former is implicitly defined by the classes in the public API of SIS.
        This page contains the information that we would have put in <code>ObjectIdentification</code> Javadoc
        is such class existed.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The <code>gco:ObjectIdentification</code> XML attribute group is implicitly included
       by all metadata types defined in the <code>org.apache.sis.metadata.iso</code> packages.
       The attributes of interest defined in this group are <code>id</code> and <code>uuid</code>.</p>

    <p>This <code>gco:ObjectIdentification</code> group is complementary to <code>gco:ObjectReference</code>,
       which defines the <code>xlink</code> and <code>uuidref</code> attributes to be supported by all metadata
       wrappers in the private <code>org.apache.sis.internal.jaxb.metadata</code> package and sub-packages.</p>

    <h2>Difference between <code>gml:id</code> and <code>gco:uuid</code></h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.seegrid.csiro.au/wiki/bin/view/AppSchemas/GmlIdentifiers">GML identifiers</a> page said:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>id</code> is a standard <strong>GML</strong> attribute available on every object-with-identity.
          It has type=<code>"xs:ID"</code> - i.e. it is a fragment identifier, unique within document scope only,
          for internal cross-references. It is not useful by itself as a persistent unique identifier.</li>

      <li><code>uuid</code> is an optional attribute available on every object-with-identity, provided in
          the <strong>GMD</strong> schemas that implement ISO 19115 in XML. May be used as a persistent
          unique identifier, but only available within GMD context.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>However according the <a href="http://schemas.opengis.net/iso/19139/20070417/gco/gcoBase.xsd">OGC schema</a>,
       those identifiers seem to be defined in the GCO schema.</p>
