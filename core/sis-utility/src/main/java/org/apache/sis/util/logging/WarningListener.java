/**
 * Intercepts non-fatal error messages logged by {@link org.apache.sis.storage.DataStore} or other SIS objects.
 * Warnings are encapsulated in {@link LogRecord} objects and logged at {@link Level#WARNING} if the emitter does not
 * have any registered any {@code WarningListener}. This listener allows applications to intercept warning records for:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>displaying the warning in a dialog or performing any other action that the application may choose,</li>
 *   <li>reducing the amount of records to be logged.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The difference between using this listener or configuring the logging {@link java.util.logging.Handler} is
 * that listeners allow to handle the warnings on a per-{@code DataStore} (or any other emitter) instance.
 *
 * @param  <S>  the base type of objects that emit warnings (the <cite>source</cite>).
