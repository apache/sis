/**
 * Constants for URL to schema directories or definition files.
 * Constants in this class are organized in three groups:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Constants with the {@code _ROOT} suffix are {@code "http://"} URL to a root directory.</li>
 *   <li>Constants with the {@code _PATH} suffix are relative paths to concatenate to a {@code _ROOT}
 *       constant in order to get the full path to a file.</li>
 *   <li>Constants with the {@code _XSD} suffix are {@code "http://"} URL to a the XSD definition file.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="section">Note on multi-lingual files</div>
 * Some files are available in two variants: with and without {@code "ML_"} prefix, which stands for "Multi Lingual".
 * Some examples are {@code "[ML_]gmxCodelists.xml"} and {@code "[ML_]gmxUom.xml"}. The following assumptions hold:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All code lists defined in a {@code ML_foo.xml} file exist also in {@code foo.xml}.</li>
 *   <li>The converse of above point is not necessarily true:
 *       the {@code ML_foo.xml} file may contain only a subset of {@code foo.xml}.</li>
 *   <li>All English descriptions in {@code ML_foo.xml} file are strictly identical to the ones in {@code foo.xml}.</li>
 *   <li>Descriptions in other languages than English exist only in {@code ML_foo.xml}.</li>
 * </ul>
