/**
 * The Apache SIS system-wide {@link ConverterRegistry}.
 * This class serves two purposes:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Fetch the list of converters from the content of all
 *       {@code META-INF/services/org.apache.sis.util.converter.ObjectConverter} files found on the classpath.
 *       The intend is to allow other modules to register their own converters.</li>
 *
 *   <li>Apply heuristic rules in addition to the explicitly registered converters.
 *       Those heuristic rules are provided in a separated class in order to keep the
 *       {@link ConverterRegistry} class a little bit more "pure", and concentrate
 *       most arbitrary decisions in this single class.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * When using {@code SystemRegistry}, new converters may "automagically" appear as a consequence
 * of the above-cited heuristic rules. This differs from the {@link ConverterRegistry} behavior,
 * where only registered converters are used.
 *
 * <div class="section">Thread safety</div>
 * The same {@link #INSTANCE} can be safely used by many threads without synchronization on the part of the caller.
