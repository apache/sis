/**
 * An exception which can produce an error message in the client locale.
 * Exceptions implementing this interface apply the following policy:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #getMessage()} returns the message in the {@linkplain Locale#getDefault() default locale}.
 *       In a client-server architecture, this is often the locale on the server side.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getLocalizedMessage()} returns the message in a locale that depends on the context
 *       in which the exception has been thrown. This is often the locale used by a {@link java.text.Format}
 *       or {@link org.apache.sis.storage.DataStore} instance,
 *       and can be presumed to be the locale on the client side.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #getInternationalMessage()} may return the message in arbitrary locale (optional operation).
 *       This method is specific to Apache SIS.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Example:</b>
 * if an error occurred while a Japanese client connected to an European server, the localized message may be sent
 * to the client in Japanese language while the same error may be logged on the server side in the French language.
 * This allows system administrator to analyze the issue without the need to understand client's language.</div>
 *
 * The above policy is applied on a <em>best-effort</em> basis only. For example exceptions that
 * do not implement {@code LocalizedException} may use any locale (not necessarily the default one),
 * and {@code LocalizedException} used as {@linkplain Exception#Exception(Throwable) wrappers} around
 * other exception usually lost their localization capability.
