AlreadyRegistered_2             = {0} \u201c{1}\u201d is already registered. The second instance will be ignored.
ChangedContainerCapacity_2      = Changed the container capacity from {0} to {1} elements.
ConformanceMeansDatumShift      = This result indicates if a datum shift method has been applied.
DiscardedExclusiveProperty_2    = Property \u201c{0}\u201d has been discarded in favor of \u201c{1}\u201d, because those two properties are mutually exclusive.
IgnoredPropertiesAfterFirst_1   = Ignored properties after the first occurrence of \u2018{0}\u2019.
IgnoredPropertyAssociatedTo_1   = Ignored property associated to \u2018{0}\u2019.
PropertyHiddenBy_2              = Property \u201c{0}\u201d is hidden by \u201c{1}\u201d.
LocalesDiscarded                = Text were discarded for some locales.
MismatchedEllipsoidAxisLength_3 = The \u201c{1}\u201d parameter could have been omitted. But it has been given a value of {2} which does not match the definition of the \u201c{0}\u201d ellipsoid.
NotFormallyAnEpsgParameter_2    = This parameter borrowed from the \u201c{0}\u201d projection is not formally a \u201c{1}\u201d parameter.
UnparsableValueStoredAsText_2   = Can not parse \u201c{1}\u201d as an instance of \u2018{0}\u2019. The value is stored as plain text instead, but will be ignored by some processing.
