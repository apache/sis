 * <p>In many cases, the columns are known in advance as hard-coded static constants.
 * Those column constants are typically documented close to the class producing the
 * {@code TreeTable} instance. Using directly those static constants provides type
 * safety, as in the following example:</p>
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     TreeTable table = ...; // Put here a TreeTable instance.
 *     TreeTable.Node node = table.getRoot();
 *     CharSequence   name = node.getValue(TableColumn.NAME);
 *     Class<?>       type = node.getValue(TableColumn.TYPE);
 * }
 *
 * In the above example, the type of value returned by the {@link Node#getValue(TableColumn)}
 * method is determined by the column constant. However this approach is possible only when
 * the table structure is known in advance. If a method needs to work with arbitrary tables,
 * then that method can get the list of columns by a call to {@link #getColumns()}. However
 * this column list does not provide the above type-safety.

         *
         * <div class="note"><b>Purpose of this method: example with ISO metadata</b><br>
         * Consider the following tree made of ISO 19115 metadata objects: a platform containing a list of instruments,
         * and an instrument containing a reference to the platform on which the instrument is installed. In this example,
         * nodes 2 and 4 contain a reference to the same {@code Platform} instance, so we have a cyclic graph:
         *
         * <table class="compact" summary="Metadata tree example">
         * <tr><th>Node 1:</th><td>{@code  }{@linkplain org.apache.sis.metadata.iso.acquisition.DefaultAcquisitionInformation Acquisition information}</td></tr>
         * <tr><th>Node 2:</th><td>{@code   └─}{@linkplain org.apache.sis.metadata.iso.acquisition.DefaultPlatform Platform}</td></tr>
         * <tr><th>Node 3:</th><td>{@code      └─}{@linkplain org.apache.sis.metadata.iso.acquisition.DefaultInstrument Instrument}</td></tr>
         * <tr><th>Node 4:</th><td>{@code         └─}{@linkplain org.apache.sis.metadata.iso.acquisition.DefaultPlatform Platform} (same instance than above)</td></tr>
         * <tr><th>Node 5:</th><td>{@code            └─}<i>etc…</i></td></tr>
         * </table>
         *
         * The {@link org.apache.sis.metadata.AbstractMetadata#asTreeTable()} method gives a view in which each node
         * has its content fully generated from wrapped metadata object. Consequently a naive walk over the above tree
         * causes an infinite loop with {@code TreeTable} generating nodes with identical content as we bounce between
         * {@code Platform} and {@code Instrument} metadata objects. To break this loop, we need to know when the
         * <em>content</em> of a node (in this example, the wrapped metadata object) has already been visited.
         * The parent shall <strong>not</strong> be taken in account since node 2 and 4 have different parents
         * despite having the same {@code Platform} content.
         *
         * <p>In this use case, the {@code Node.equals(Object)} implementation needs only to compare the wrapped
         * metadata (usually given by the {@linkplain #getUserObject() user object}) since the node content,
         * including the list of children, is fully determined by those metadata. An identity comparison
         * (with {@code ==}) is sufficient for the purpose of avoiding infinite recursivity.</p></div>
         *
         * <div class="section">Flexibility in implementations</div>
         * The above list specifies minimal conditions that must be true when two nodes are considered equal.
         * Implementations should not relax those conditions, but are free to make them more restrictive.
         * In particular, many implementations will require that the two nodes are instances of the same class.
         * Some implementations may also perform identity comparisons (with the {@code ==} operator) between values
         * instead than using {@link Object#equals(Object)}. This flexibility means that even if all above conditions
         * are true, this is not a guarantee that this method will return {@code true}.
         *
         * <p>It is okay to <em>not</em> override this method at all since the identity comparison inherited from
         * {@link Object#equals(Object)} is consistent with this method contract. Alternatively, {@code Node}
         * implementations having a content fully determined by the wrapped {@linkplain #getUserObject() user
         * object} need only the following implementation:</p>
         *
         * {@preformat java
         *     &#64;Override
         *     public boolean equals(Object obj) {
         *         return (obj instanceof MyNode) && ((MyNode) obj).getUserObject() == getUserObject();
         *     }
         * }
         *
         * Implementation details may vary, for example in the way to compare {@code null} user objects or by invoking
         * {@link Object#equals(Object)} instead than performing identity comparisons. Note however that since this
         * method purpose is to detect cyclic graphs (see above example), user objects should be compared with
         * {@code equals(Object)} only if their implementations are known to be safe against infinite recursivity.
         *
         * @param  other  the other object to compare with this node.
         * @return whether the two objects are nodes with equal values and equal children, ignoring parents.
