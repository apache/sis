 * do so when the object is a final Java class like {@link Boolean}, {@link Integer}, {@link Double} or {@link String}.
 * This class provides a workaround using specific instances of those wrappers.

     *
     * <div class="section">Identity comparisons</div>
     * We really need an identity hash map; using the {@code Object.equals(Object)} method is not allowed here.
     * This is because "nil values" are real values. For example if the type is {@link Integer}, then the nil value
     * is an {@code Integer} instance having the value 0. We don't want to consider every 0 integer value as nil,
     * but only the specific {@code Integer} instance used as sentinel value for nil.
     *
     * <div class="section">Weak references</div>
     * We can not use weak value references, because we don't want the {@link NilReason} (the map value) to be lost
     * while the sentinel value (the map key) is still in use. We could use weak references for the keys, but JDK 7
     * does not provides any map implementation which is both an {@code IdentityHashMap} and a {@code WeakHashMap}.
     *
     * For now we do not use weak references. This means that if a user creates a custom {@code NilReason} by a call
     * to {@link NilReason#valueOf(String)}, and if he uses that nil reason for a primitive type, then that custom
     * {@code NilReason} instance and its sentinel values will never be garbage-collected.
     * We presume that such cases will be rare enough for not being an issue in practice.
     *
     * <div class="section">Synchronization</div>
     * All accesses to this map shall be synchronized on the map object.
