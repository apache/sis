/**
 * The range of values assignable to a field, or to a JavaBean property.
 * When used with JavaBeans, this annotation shall be applied on the getter method
 * as in the following example:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     &#64;ValueRange(minimum=0, maximum=100)
 *     public double getCloudCoverPercentage() {
 *         // Method implementation here...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * By default, both endpoints are inclusive. To make an endpoint exclusive,
 * a {@code isFooInclusive} argument needs to be explicitely provided. This
 * is useful mostly for floating point numbers. In the following example,
 * values can be very close to zero but not equals, since a value of exactly
 * zero makes no sense. Note also that the {@code maximum} value is not explicitely
 * provided, in which case it defaults to infinity.
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     &#64;@ValueRange(minimum=0, isMinIncluded=false)
 *     public double getSpatialResolution() {
 *         // Method implementation here...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * It is sometime convenient to convert {@code ValueRange} to {@link NumberRange} instances
 * in order to leverage the various {@code NumberRange} operations. The following example
 * uses a convenience constructor for this purpose. Note that the {@code Double} type could
 * by inferred from {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#getReturnType()}.
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     Method myMethod = ...;
 *     ValueRange annotation = myMethod.getAnnotation(ValueRange.class);
 *     if (annotation != null) {
 *         NumberRange<Double> range = new NumberRange(Double.class, annotation);
 *         // Use the range here.
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * The {@link org.apache.sis.metadata.AbstractMetadata} class uses this annotation for inferring
 * {@link org.opengis.parameter.ParameterDescriptor} from metadata interfaces and implementation
 * classes.
