/**
 * Thrown to indicate that an operation could not complete because of a failure in the backing store
 * (a file or a database). This exception is thrown by implementations of API (collection, streams,
 * <i>etc.</i> that are not allowed to throw checked exceptions.
 * This exception usually has an {@link IOException} or a {@link SQLException} as its {@linkplain #getCause() cause}.
 *
 * <p>This method provides a {@link #unwrapOrRethrow(Class)} convenience method which can be used
 * for re-throwing the cause as in the example below. This allows client code to behave as if a
 * {@link java.util.Collection} interface was allowed to declare checked exceptions.</p>

 *     void myMethod() throws IOException {
 *         Collection c = ...;

 *
 * <div class="section">Relationship with {@code java.io.UncheckedIOException}</div>
 * JDK8 provides a {@link java.io.UncheckedIOException} which partially overlaps
 * the purpose of this {@code BackingStoreException}. While Apache SIS still uses
 * {@code BackingStoreException} as a general mechanism for any kind of checked
 * exceptions, client code targeting JDK8 would be well advised to catch both kind
 * of exceptions for robustness.
