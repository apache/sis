 * {@link org.apache.sis.internal.jaxb.IdentifierMapAdapter} is our internal implementation of
 * the public {@link org.apache.sis.xml.IdentifierMap} interface. The actual implementation is
 * usually the {@code ModifiableIdentifierMap} subclass.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.apache.sis.internal.jaxb.SpecializedIdentifier} wraps {@link org.apache.sis.xml.XLink},
 * {@link java.net.URI} and {@link java.util.UUID} as {@link org.opengis.metadata.Identifier} instances.
 * This is used for storing the value in a list of identifiers while preserving the original object.</p>
