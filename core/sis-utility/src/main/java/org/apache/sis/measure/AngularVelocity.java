/**
 * The rate of change of an angular displacement with respect to time.
 * The SI unit is radians per second (rad/s) and the EPSG code is 1035.
 * This quantity is used for describing the rate of changes of {@code rX}, {@code rY}Â and {@code rZ} terms in
 * {@linkplain org.apache.sis.referencing.datum.BursaWolfParameters Bursa-Wolf parameters}, under the effect
 * of plate tectonics.
 *
 * <p>Most quantity types are defined in the {@link javax.measure.quantity}.
 * This {@code AngularVelocity} type is an extension to the standard types.</p>
