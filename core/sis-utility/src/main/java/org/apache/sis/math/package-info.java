/**
 * A set of mathematical objects and algebraic utilities.
 * This package provides:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Static functions in {@link org.apache.sis.math.MathFunctions} and {@link org.apache.sis.math.DecimalFunctions}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.sis.math.Statistics} accumulator, optionally with statistics on derivatives
 *       and {@linkplain org.apache.sis.math.StatisticsFormat tabular formatting}.</li>
 *   <li>Simple equations for {@link org.apache.sis.math.Line} and {@link org.apache.sis.math.Plane}
 *       with capability to determine the coefficients from a set of coordinates.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
 * {@code Line} and {@code Plane} classes are not geometric objects since they are not bounded in space.
 * For example the {@link java.awt.geom.Line2D} geometry have starting and ending points, while the
 * {@code Line} class in this package extends to infinite.</div>
