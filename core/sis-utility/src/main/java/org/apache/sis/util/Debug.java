/**
 * Annotates classes or methods that are provided mostly for debugging purpose. This annotation
 * is defined in order to make easier to find which debugging tools are available in case of
 * problem. See the <cite>"Use"</cite> javadoc link for a list of annotated classes and methods.
 *
 * <div class="section">{@code Object.toString()} policy</div>
 * Subclasses override the {@link Object#toString()} method for various purposes, sometime providing
 * content targeted to the end user (e.g. {@link java.lang.CharSequence}) and sometime providing
 * debugging information for developers only. In the Apache SIS library, {@code toString()}
 * methods without {@code @Debug} annotation shall be understandable by the end users,
 * while {@code toString()} methods with {@code @Debug} annotation is targeted to
 * developers and may change in any future version.
