/**
 * A concurrent cache mechanism. This implementation is thread-safe and supports concurrency.
 * A cache entry can be locked when an object is in process of being created. The steps
 * are as below:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Check if the value is already available in the map.
 *       If it is, return it immediately and we are done.</li>
 *   <li>Otherwise, get a lock and check again if the value is already available in the map
 *       (because the value could have been computed by an other thread between step 1 and
 *       the obtention of the lock). If it is, release the lock and we are done.</li>
 *   <li>Otherwise compute the value, store the result and release the lock.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The easiest way (except for exception handling) to use this class is to prepare a
 * {@link Callable} statement to be executed only if the object is not in the cache,
 * and to invoke the {@link #getOrCreate getOrCreate} method. Example:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     private final Cache<String,MyObject> cache = new Cache<String,MyObject>();
 *
 *     public MyObject getMyObject(final String key) throws MyCheckedException {
 *         try {
 *             return cache.getOrCreate(key, new Callable<MyObject>() {
 *                 MyObject call() throws FactoryException {
 *                     return createMyObject(key);
 *                 }
 *             });
 *         } catch (MyCheckedException | RuntimeException e) {
 *             throw e;
 *         } catch (Exception e) {
 *             throw new UndeclaredThrowableException(e);
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * An alternative is to perform explicitly all the steps enumerated above. This alternative
 * avoid the creation of a temporary {@code Callable} statement which may never be executed,
 * and avoid the exception handling due to the {@code throws Exception} clause. Note that the
 * call to {@link Handler#putAndUnlock putAndUnlock} <strong>must</strong> be in the {@code finally}
 * block of a {@code try} block beginning immediately after the call to {@link #lock lock},
 * no matter what the result of the computation is (including {@code null}).
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     private final Cache<String,MyObject> cache = new Cache<String,MyObject>();
 *
 *     public MyObject getMyObject(final String key) throws MyCheckedException {
 *         MyObject value = cache.peek(key);
 *         if (value == null) {
 *             final Cache.Handler<MyObject> handler = cache.lock(key);
 *             try {
 *                 value = handler.peek();
 *                 if (value == null) {
 *                     value = createMyObject(key);
 *                 }
 *             } finally {
 *                 handler.putAndUnlock(value);
 *             }
 *         }
 *         return value;
 *     }
 * }

 *
 * <div class="section">Eviction of eldest values</div>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The <cite>cost</cite> of a value is the value returned by {@link #cost}. The default
 *       implementation returns 1 in all cases, but subclasses can override this method for
 *       more elaborated cost computation.</li>
 *   <li>The <cite>total cost</cite> is the sum of the cost of all values held by strong
 *       reference in this cache. The total cost does not include the cost of values held
 *       by {@linkplain Reference weak or soft reference}.</li>
 *   <li>The <cite>cost limit</cite> is the maximal value allowed for the total cost. If
 *       the total cost exceed this value, then strong references to the eldest values are
 *       replaced by {@linkplain Reference weak or soft references} until the total cost
 *       become equals or lower than the cost limit.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The total cost is given at construction time. If the {@link #cost} method has not been
 * overridden, then the total cost is the maximal amount of values to keep by strong references.
 *
 *
 * <div class="section">Circular dependencies</div>
 *
 * This implementation assumes that there is no circular dependencies (or cyclic graph) between
 * the values in the cache. For example if creating <var>A</var> implies creating <var>B</var>,
 * then creating <var>B</var> is not allowed to implies (directly or indirectly) the creation of
 * <var>A</var>. If this rule is not meet, deadlock may occur randomly.
