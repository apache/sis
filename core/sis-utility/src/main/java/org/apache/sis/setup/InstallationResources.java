/**
 * Resources needed for installation of third-party or optional components.
 * {@code InstallationResources} can be used for downloading large files that may not be of interest
 * to every users, or data that are subject to more restricting terms of use than the Apache license.
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Examples:</b><ul>
 * <li>The NADCON grid files provide <cite>datum shifts</cite> data for North America.
 *     Since those files are in the public domain, they could be bundled in Apache SIS.
 *     But the weight of those files (about 2.4 Mb) is unnecessary for users who do not live in North America.</li>
 * <li>On the other hand, the <a href="http://www.epsg.org/">EPSG geodetic dataset</a> is important for most users.
 *     Codes like {@code "EPSG:4326"} became a <i>de-facto</i> standard in various places like <cite>Web Map Services</cite>,
 *     images encoded in GeoTIFF format, <i>etc</i>. But the <a href="http://www.epsg.org/TermsOfUse">EPSG terms of use</a>
 *     are more restrictive than the Apache license and require that we inform the users about those conditions.</li>
 * </ul></div>
 *
 * Some classes that depend on installation resources are:
 * {@link org.apache.sis.referencing.factory.sql.EPSGFactory}.
 * In order to allow those classes to discover which resources are available,
 * {@code InstallationResources} implementations shall be declared in the following file:
 *
 * {@preformat text
 *     META-INF/services/org.apache.sis.setup.InstallationResources
 * }
 *
 * Above registration is usually done automatically when extension modules are added on the classpath.
 * For example adding the {@code org.apache.sis.non-free:â€‹sis-epsg} Maven dependency as documented on
 * the <a href="http://sis.apache.org/epsg.html">Apache SIS web site</a> is the only step needed for
 * allowing Apache SIS to read the EPSG scripts (however SIS still needs an installation directory
 * for writing the database; see above-cited web page for more information).
