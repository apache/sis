/**
 * A set of helper classes for the SIS implementation.

 * <STRONG>Do not use!</STRONG>
 *
 * This package is for internal use by SIS only. Classes in this package
 * may change in incompatible ways in any future version without notice.
 *
 * <div class="section">Note on serialization</div>
 * Developers should avoid putting serializable classes in this package as much as possible,
 * since the serialization forms may be considered as a kind of API contract (depending how
 * much strict we want to be regarding compatibility). This is not always practical however,
 * so some serialized classes still exist in this package.
