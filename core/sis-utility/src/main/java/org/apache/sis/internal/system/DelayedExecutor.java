/**
 * A thread executing short tasks after some (potentially zero nanosecond) delay.
 * This class should be reserved to internal SIS usage without user's code.
 * In practice some user code may be indirectly executed through SIS tasks invoking overrideable methods.
 * But all submitted tasks shall be very quick, since there is only one thread shared by everyone.
 *
 * <p>The methods for use in this class are:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #schedule(Runnable, long)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="section">Comparison with {@code java.util.concurrent}</div>
 * We tried to use {@link java.util.concurrent.ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor} in a previous SIS version,
 * but its "fixed-sized pool" design forces us to use only one thread if we do not want to waste resources
 * (profiling shows that even a single thread has very low activity), which reduces the interest of that class.
 * Combination of {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} super-class with {@code DelayedQueue} were not successful neither.
 *
 * <p>Given that it:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>it seems difficult to configure {@code (Scheduled)ThreadPoolExecutor} in such a way
 *       that two or more threads are created only when really needed,</li>
 *   <li>using those executor services seems an overkill when the pool size is fixed to one thread,</li>
 *   <li>our profiling has show very low activity for that single thread anyway,</li>
 *   <li>we do not need cancellation and shutdown services for house keeping tasks (this is a daemon thread),</li>
 * </ul>
 * a more lightweight solution seems acceptable here. Pseudo-benchmarking using the
 * {@code CacheTest.stress()} tests suggests that the lightweight solution is faster.
