     * This method does <strong>not</strong> ignore trailing zeros.
     * For example {@code fractionDigitsForValue(1.0)} returns 16,
     * because the {@code double} format can store <i>almost</i> 16 decimal digits after 1.
     *
     * <div class="note"><b>Note:</b>
     * We said <cite>almost</cite> because the very last digit may be able to store only a subset
     * of the [0 … 9] digits.</div>
     *
     * Invoking this method is equivalent to invoking <code>{@linkplain #fractionDigitsForDelta(double, boolean)
     * fractionDigitsForDelta}(Math.{@linkplain Math#ulp(double) ulp}(value), false)</code>, except that it is
     * potentially faster.
     *
     * <p>Special cases:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>If {@code value} is {@link Double#NaN NaN} or infinity, then this method returns 0
     *       since those values are not represented by decimal digits.</li>
     *
     *   <li>If {@code value} is 0, then this method returns 324 since
     *       {@code Math.ulp(0)} = {@value java.lang.Double#MIN_VALUE}.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <div class="note"><b>Example:</b>
     * This method is useful with {@link java.text.NumberFormat} for formatting all significant digits of a
     * {@code double} value, padding with trailing zeros if necessary, but no more than necessary.</div>
