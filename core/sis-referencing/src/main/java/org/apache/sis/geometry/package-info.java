/**
 * Basic geometric objects (envelopes and direct positions). Every geometry objects are associated
 * with a {@linkplain org.apache.sis.referencing.crs.AbstractCRS Coordinate Reference System},
 * which may have an arbitrary number of dimensions. However a few specialized classes restrict
 * the CRS to a fixed number of dimensions only. The table below summarizes the most common
 * objects, and list the Java2D classes that are conceptually equivalent.
 *

 *   <tr>
 *     <th>Purpose</th>
 *     <th>Any dimension</th>
 *     <th>One dimension</th>

 * <div class="section">Java2D dependency</div>
 * All classes having a name that ends with "2D" are designed for inter-operability with Java2D.
 * All other classes have no dependency to Java2D.
 * This clear separation aims to make easier to use Apache SIS on platforms that do not support Java2D
 * (for example Android) or to avoid loading Java2D classes when only JavaFX is desired.
 *
 * <div class="section">Envelopes spanning the anti-meridian of a Geographic CRS</div>
 * The Web Coverage Service (WCS) 1.1 specification uses an extended interpretation
 * of the bounding box definition. In a WCS 1.1 data structure, the
 * {@linkplain org.apache.sis.geometry.GeneralEnvelope#getLowerCorner() lower corner}
 * defines the edges region in the directions of <em>decreasing</em> coordinate values in the
 * {@linkplain org.apache.sis.geometry.GeneralEnvelope#getCoordinateReferenceSystem() envelope CRS},
 * while the {@linkplain org.apache.sis.geometry.GeneralEnvelope#getUpperCorner() upper corner}
 * defines the edges region in the directions of <em>increasing</em> coordinate values.
 * Those lower and upper corners are usually the algebraic
 * {@linkplain org.apache.sis.geometry.GeneralEnvelope#getMinimum(int) minimum} and
 * {@linkplain org.apache.sis.geometry.GeneralEnvelope#getMaximum(int) maximum} coordinates respectively,
 * but not always. For example, an envelope crossing the anti-meridian could have a lower corner
 * longitude greater than the upper corner longitude, like the red box below (the green box is the
 * usual case):
 *
 * <center><img src="doc-files/AntiMeridian.png" alt="Envelope spannning the anti-meridian"></center>
 *
 * In SIS, every envelopes defined in this package support the extended bounding box interpretation:
 * for any dimension, ordinate values such that <var>upper</var> &lt; <var>lower</var> are handled
 * in a special way. This handling is slightly different for two groups of methods:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>In calculation of envelopes spans and median positions (centers) — handled specially only
 *       on axes having the {@link org.opengis.referencing.cs.RangeMeaning#WRAPAROUND WRAPAROUND}
 *       range meaning.</li>
 *   <li>When checking for containment, intersections or unions — can be handled specially for
 *       any axis, in which case the envelope represents an <em>exclusion</em> area instead
 *       than an inclusion area.</li>
 * </ul>
