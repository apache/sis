/**
 * A usually affine, or otherwise a projective transform, which convert coordinates using only linear equations.
 * A projective transform is capable of mapping an arbitrary quadrilateral into another arbitrary quadrilateral,
 * while preserving the straightness of lines. In the special case where the transform is affine, the parallelism
 * of lines in the source is preserved in the output.
 *
 * <p>Such a coordinate transformation can be represented by a matrix of arbitrary size, which is given by the
 * {@link #getMatrix()} method. The relationship between matrix size and transform dimensions is as below:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The {@linkplain Matrix#getNumCol() number of columns} in the matrix is equal to
 *       the number of {@linkplain #getSourceDimensions() source dimensions} plus 1</li>
 *   <li>The {@linkplain Matrix#getNumRow() number of rows} in the matrix is equal to
 *       the number of {@linkplain #getTargetDimensions() target dimensions} plus 1.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <div class="section">Affine transform</div>
 * In most cases the transform in affine. For such transforms, the last matrix row contains only zero values
 * except in the last column, which contains 1. For example a conversion from projected coordinates (metres)
 * to display coordinates (pixel) can be done as below:
 *
 * <center>
 * <img src="../matrix/doc-files/AffineTransform.png" alt="Matrix representation of an affine transform">
 * </center>
 *
 * <div class="section">Projective transform</div>
 * If the last matrix row does not met the above constraints, then the transform is not affine.
 * A <cite>projective</cite> transform can be used as a generalization of affine transforms.
 * In such case the computation performed by SIS is similar to {@code PerspectiveTransform}
 * in <cite>Java Advanced Imaging</cite>.
 * For example a square matrix of size 4×4 is used for transforming three-dimensional coordinates.
 * The transformed points {@code (x',y',z')} are computed as below:
 *
 * <center>{@include formulas.html#ProjectiveTransform}</center>
 *
 * <div class="section">Instantiation</div>
 * The easiest way to instantiate a {@code LinearTransform} is to use the {@link MathTransforms#linear(Matrix)}
 * convenience method.
