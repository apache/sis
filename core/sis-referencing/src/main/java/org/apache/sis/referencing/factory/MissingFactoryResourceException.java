/**
 * Thrown when an object can not be created because a resource is missing.
 * The most common case is a NADCON or NTv2 datum shift operation requested while the
 * datum shift grids was not found in the {@code $SIS_DATA/DatumChanges} directory.
 *
 * <div class="section">Relationship with other exceptions</div>
 * This exception means that the factory failed to create a particular object.
 * However the factory may succeed in creating other objects.
 * By contrast, {@link UnavailableFactoryException} means that the whole factory can not be used at all.
 *
 * <p>This exception is <strong>not</strong> for unimplemented operations (for example map projections not yet supported).
 * For unimplemented operation methods, use {@link org.opengis.util.NoSuchIdentifierException} instead.</p>
