 * <div class="section">Discussion on axis order</div>
 * The axis order is specified by the authority (typically a national agency) defining the Coordinate Reference System
 * (CRS). The order depends on the CRS type and the country defining the CRS. In the case of geographic CRS, the
 * (<var>latitude</var>, <var>longitude</var>) axis order is widely used by geographers and pilotes for centuries.
 * However software developers tend to consistently use the (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) order for every kind of CRS.
 * Those different practices resulted in contradictory definitions of axis order for almost every CRS of kind
 * {@code GeographicCRS}, for some {@code ProjectedCRS} in the South hemisphere (South Africa, Australia, <i>etc.</i>)
 * and for some polar projections among others.
 *
 * <p>Recent OGC standards mandate the use of axis order as defined by the authority. Oldest OGC standards used the
 * (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) axis order instead, ignoring any authority specification. Many software products still use
 * the old (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) axis order, because it is easier to implement. Apache SIS supports both conventions.
 * By default, SIS creates CRS with axis order as defined by the authority. Those CRS are created by calls to the
 * {@link org.apache.sis.referencing.CRS#forCode(String)} method. The actual axis order can be verified after the CRS
 * creation with {@code System.out.println(crs)}. If (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) axis order is wanted for compatibility
 * with older OGC specifications or other software products, CRS forced to "longitude first" axis order can be created
 * using the {@link #CONVENTIONALLY_ORIENTED} or {@link #NORMALIZED} enumeration value.</p>
 *
 * <div class="section">Range of longitude values</div>
 * Most geographic CRS have a longitude axis defined in the [-180 … +180]° range. All map projections in Apache SIS are
 * designed to work in that range. This is also the range of {@link Math} trigonometric functions like {@code atan2(y,x)}.
 * However some data use the [0 … 360]° range instead. A geographic CRS can be shifted to that range of longitude values
 * using the {@link #POSITIVE_RANGE} enumeration value. The choice of longitude range will impact not only some
 * coordinate conversions, but also the methods that verify the <cite>domain of validity</cite>
 * (e.g. {@link org.apache.sis.geometry.GeneralEnvelope#normalize()}).
