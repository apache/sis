         *      uses 'equals', there is a risk of inconsistency.
         *
         *   2) The 'synchronized (methods)' statement introduces a risk of deadlock if some implementations of
         *      'OperationMethod.equals(Object)' invokes DefaultMathTransformFactory methods. Of course no such
         *      callbacks should exist (and Apache SIS don't do that), but the OperationMethods can be supplied
         *      by users and Murphy's law said that if something can go wrong, it will go wrong.
         *
         * Since there is no evidence at this time that we need an efficient OperationMethodSet.contains(Object)
         * implementation, we keep for now the slowest but more conservative approach inherited from AbstractSet.
         * However this choice may be revisited in any future SIS version if necessary.
