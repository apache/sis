/**
 * Strategy for iterating over the point arrays given to
 * {@link AbstractMathTransform#transform(double[], int, double[], int, int)
 * AbstractMathTransform.transform(…)} methods.
 * If the source and destination arrays are the same and the region of the array to be written
 * overlaps the region of the array to be read, it may be necessary to iterate over the points
 * in reverse order or to copy some points in a temporary array.
 * The {@link #suggest(int, int, int, int, int)  suggest(…)} method in this class returns a strategy
 * suitable to the {@code transform} arguments.
 *
 * <div class="section">Usage</div>
 * The following code gives a skeleton for a {@code AbstractMathTransform} implementation
 * capable to transform an array of {@code double} coordinates:
 *
 * {@preformat java

 *         {

 *             int dstInc = getTargetDimension();

 *                 // Repeat as many time as needed for dimension of input points.
 *
