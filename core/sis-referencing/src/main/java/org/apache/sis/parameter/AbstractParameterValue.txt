There is no AbstractParameterValue class because we do not need it.
However if a public AbstractParameterValue class is provided in the
future, then we could simplify a little bit the JAXB annotations on
CC_GeneralParameterValue.getElement(). We don't do that for now
because this is a too minor convenience for growing the public API.
