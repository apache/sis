/**
 * Helper classes for creating {@linkplain org.apache.sis.referencing.operation.transform.AbstractMathTransform
 * Math Transforms} from a set of points.
 * The builder classes require a matched set of known positions, one from a "source" data set and another
 * from a "target" data set. The builder will then provide a transformation positions from the "source" CRS
 * to the "target" CRS.
 *
 * <p>Algorithms in this package use a <cite>least squares</cite> estimation method.
 * The matching parameters are estimated by minimizing the sum of the squared distances
 * between the given points and the fitted points (i.e. the points calculated using the
 * transform). Note that "distance" here is not necessarily the Euclidian distance or a
 * geodesic distance. It may be an approximation of Euclidian distance for implementation
 * convenience.</p>
