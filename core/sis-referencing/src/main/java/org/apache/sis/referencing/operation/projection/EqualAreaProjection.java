     * the series expansion is unconditionally followed by iterative method in order to reach the centimetric precision.
     * We observe that the original series expansion allows convergence in only one iteration, while the formulas using
     * trigonometric identifies often requires two iterations. Consequently we disallow those modifications for now.</p>
