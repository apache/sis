/**
 * Base class of {@link LambertConicConformal}, {@link Mercator} and {@link PolarStereographic} projections.
 * All those projections have in common the property of being <cite>conformal</cite>, i.e. they preserve
 * angles locally. However we do not put this base class in public API because we do not (yet) guarantee
 * than all conformal projections will extend this base class.
 *
 * <p>This base class can been seen as a generalization of <cite>Lambert Conic Conformal</cite> projection,
 * which includes some other projections like Mercator and Polar Stereographic as special cases.
 * For this base class, the Mercator projection is considered as <cite>"a special limiting case of the
 * Lambert Conic Conformal map projection with the equator as the single standard parallel."</cite>
 * (Source: §1.3.3 in IOGP Publication 373-7-2 – Geomatics Guidance Note number 7, part 2 – April 2015).
 * Indeed, those two projections have some equation in commons which are provided in this base class.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Polar Stereographic projection is not documented as a special case of Lambert Conic Conformal,
 * but the equations in the {@code PolarStereographic.transform(…)} and {@code inverseTransform(…)} methods
 * appear to be the same with the <var>n</var> factor fixed to 1 or -1, so we leverage the code provided by
 * this base class. This class hierarchy is only an implementation convenience and not part of public API.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Transverse Mercator projection is also conformal, but does not use the formulas provided in this class.
 * It will instead compute the coefficients itself and use its own, more complex, formulas with those coefficients.
 * However the formulas provided in this {@code ConformalProjection} class can be seen as a special case of
 * Transverse Mercator formulas for <var>x</var> = 0.</p>
 *
 * <div class="note"><b>Reference:</b>
 * “Lambert developed the regular Conformal Conic as the oblique aspect of a family containing the previously
 * known polar Stereographic and regular Mercator projections. (…) If the standard parallels are symmetrical
 * about the Equator, the regular Mercator results (although formulas must be revised). If the only standard
 * parallel is a pole, the polar Stereographic results.” (Snyder, page 105)</div>
