/**
 * Finds the extremum of the unique cubic curve which fit the two given points and derivatives.
 * First, this method finds the A, B, C and D coefficients for the following equation:
 *
 * <blockquote><var>y</var> = A + B<var>x</var> + C<var>x</var>² + D<var>x</var>³</blockquote>
 *
 * Next, this method finds the extremum by finding the (<var>x</var>,<var>y</var>) values
 * that satisfy the following equation (which is the derivative of the above equation):
 *
 * <blockquote>B + 2C<var>x</var> + 3D<var>x</var>² = 0</blockquote>
 *
 * A cubic curve can have two extremum, which are stored in this object in no particular order.
 * The distance separating the two extremum is sometime a useful information for determining if
 * a quadratic equation would be a sufficient approximation.
 *
 * <p>The points stored in this object may contains {@linkplain Double#NaN NaN} values if the
 * given geometry is actually a line segment ({@code dy1} = {@code dy2} = slope from P1 to P2).</p>
