/**
 * Base class for math transforms that are known to be two-dimensional in all cases.
 * Two-dimensional math transforms are not required to extend this class,
 * however doing so may simplify their implementation.
 *
 * <p>The simplest way to implement this abstract class is to provide an implementation for the following methods
 * only:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #transform(double[], int, double[], int, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * However more performance may be gained by overriding the other {@code transform} methods as well.
 *
 * <div class="section">Immutability and thread safety</div>
 * All Apache SIS implementations of {@code MathTransform2D} are immutable and thread-safe.
 * It is highly recommended that third-party implementations be immutable and thread-safe too.
 * This means that unless otherwise noted in the javadoc, {@code MathTransform2D} instances can
 * be shared by many objects and passed between threads without synchronization.
 *
 * <div class="section">Serialization</div>
 * {@code MathTransform2D} may or may not be serializable, at implementation choices.
 * Most Apache SIS implementations are serializable, but the serialized objects are not guaranteed to be compatible
 * with future SIS versions. Serialization should be used only for short term storage or RMI between applications
 * running the same SIS version.
