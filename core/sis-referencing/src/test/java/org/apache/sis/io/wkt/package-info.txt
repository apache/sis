The "org.apache.sis.io.wkt" package is defined in the "sis-metadata" module,
but some of their classes can not be tested there because they depend on the
"sis-referencing" module. Those classes are tested here.

The reason for this split is that formatting does not need to know classes
in advance since we just invoke an overrideable method.  But parsing needs
to know all classes, which is why we can test it only in this module.
