    Overview of <a href="{@website}">Apache SIS™ (Spatial Information System)</a>.

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>SIS requires Java 6 Standard Edition.</p>

    <h3>Javadoc annotations</h3>
    <p>SIS uses standard javadoc annotations. The meaning of some tags are refined as below:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>{@code @since}   - the SIS version when the annotated element (class, method, <i>etc.</i>) was first introduced.</li>
      <li>{@code @version} - the last SIS version when the code of the annotated class got a significant change.</li>
      <li>{@code @author}  - developer names in <var>First name</var> <var>Last name</var> <var>(organization)</var> format.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Classes naming</h3>
    <p>Implementations of <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/">GeoAPI interfaces</a> usually (but not always)
    begin with {@code Abstract}, {@code Default}, {@code Simple} or {@code General} prefix.
    The {@code Abstract} prefix is used when a class is abstract according ISO specifications -
    it may or may not be be abstract in the Java sense.
    The {@code General} prefix is used when an implementation is designed for use in the general case,
    as opposed to other implementations specialized for a fixed number of dimensions or other conditions.
    Implementations specialized for a fixed number of dimensions are suffixed with {@code 1D}, {@code 2D},
    {@code 3D} or {@code 4D} rather than being prefixed.</p>

    <p>Classes that are not GeoAPI implementation are usually not prefixed by any of the above.</p>
