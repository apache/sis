    Overview of <a href="http://sis.apache.org">Apache SISâ„¢ (Spatial Information System)</a>.

    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    <p>SIS requires Java 7 Standard Edition.</p>

    <h3>Classes naming</h3>
    <p>Implementations of <a href="http://www.geoapi.org/">GeoAPI interfaces</a> usually (but not always)
    begin with {@code Abstract}, {@code Default}, {@code Simple} or {@code General} prefix.
    The {@code Abstract} prefix is used when a class is abstract according ISO specifications -
    it may or may not be be abstract in the Java sense.
    The {@code General} prefix is used when an implementation is designed for use in the general case,
    as opposed to other implementations specialized for a fixed number of dimensions or other conditions.
    Implementations specialized for a fixed number of dimensions are suffixed with {@code 1D}, {@code 2D},
    {@code 3D} or {@code 4D} rather than being prefixed.</p>

    <p>Classes that are not GeoAPI implementation are usually not prefixed by any of the above.</p>
