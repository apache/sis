==============================================
Welcome to Apache SIS <https://sis.apache.org>
==============================================

SIS is a project of the Apache Software Foundation <https://www.apache.org>
for developing geospatial applications in the Java programming language.
The library can be used for desktop or server applications.

Apache SIS, SIS, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache SIS
project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF).


Installation
============

For developing applications using the SIS library or for using on command-line,
the only requirement is Java 11 or later, except the GDAL module which requires
Java 22. For launching the desktop application, requirements are Java 22 or later
and JavaFX 24 or later.

1) Unzip `apache-sis-1.4-bin.zip` in any directory.
2) Invoke `./apache-sis-1.4/bin/sis` for the command-line.
3) Invoke `./apache-sis-1.4/bin/sisfx` for the graphical application.

The `apache-sis-1.4/bin` directory may also be added to the `PATH` environment
variable for making `sis` or `sisfx` invocations easier.


Configuration (Unix only)
=========================

A `SIS_OPTS` environment variable can optionally be set for specifying options
to be given to any execution of Apache SIS. For example for setting the
encoding to UTF-8 in the console application:

    export SIS_OPTS="--encoding UTF-8"

Optional dependencies can be added to the `lib` folder. For example adding the
UCAR netCDF library in the `lib` folder will allow Apache SIS to decode a wider
range of file formats like NcML files.
