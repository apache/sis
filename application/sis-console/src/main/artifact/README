=============================================
Welcome to Apache SIS <http://sis.apache.org>
=============================================

SIS is a project of the Apache Software Foundation <http://www.apache.org>
for developing geospatial applications in the Java programming language.
The library can be used for desktop or server applications.

Apache SIS, SIS, Apache, the Apache feather logo, and the Apache SIS
project logo are trademarks of The Apache Software Foundation.


Installation
============

SIS is based on Java 6 and provided as a unique standalone JAR file.

Unix
----
1) Unzip 'apache-sis-0.8-bin.zip' in any directory.
2) Add the 'apache-sis-0.8/bin' directory to the path.
3) Invoke 'sis' on the command line.

Windows
-------
There is not yet 'sis.bat' file for Windows.
The following steps need to be done manually:

1) Unzip 'apache-sis-0.8-bin.zip' in any directory.
2) In the 'apache-sis-0.8/lib' directory, execute:

     unpack200 --remove-pack-file sis.pack.gz sis.jar

3) Invoke 'java -jar lib/sis.jar' on the command line.


Configuration (Unix only)
=========================

A 'SIS_OPTS' environment variable can optionally be set for specifying options
to be given to any execution of Apache SIS. For example for setting the
encoding to UTF-8:

    export SIS_OPTS="--encoding UTF-8"

Optional dependencies can be added to the 'lib' folder. For example adding the
UCAR NetCDF library in the 'lib' folder will cause Apache SIS to decode a
wider range of file formats like NcML files.
