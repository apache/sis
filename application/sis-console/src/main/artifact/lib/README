This directory contains the sis.jar file together with optional dependencies.
Recognized optional dependencies are:

  - Derby database
  - JAXB implementation
  - UCAR netCDF library
  - ESRI Geometry API
  - Java Topology Suite

The "linux", "darwin" and "windows" sub-directories contain bridges to Proj.4
and other libraries through Java Native Interfaces (JNI). They do not contain
the actual libraries however; Apache SIS uses the libraries installed on host
computer by packages manager, if any. Those libraries are optional.
