=============================================
Welcome to Apache SIS <http://sis.apache.org>
=============================================

SIS is a free software, Java language library for developing geospatial
applications. The library can be used for desktop or server applications.
SIS is an implementation of GeoAPI 3.0 interfaces. SIS provides data structures
for geographic data and associated metadata along with methods to manipulate
those data structures. The SIS metadata module forms the base of the library
and enables the creation of metadata objects which comply with the ISO 19115
metadata model and which can be read from or written to ISO 19139 compliant
XML documents. The SIS referencing module will enable the construction of
geodetic data structures for geospatial referencing based on the ISO 19111
model such as axis, projection and coordinate reference system definitions,
along with the associated operations which enable the mathematical conversion
of coordinates between different systems of reference. The SIS storage modules
will provide a common approach to the reading and writing of grid coverages
applicable to simple imagery as to many dimensional data structures.

SIS is a project of the Apache Software Foundation <http://www.apache.org/>.
