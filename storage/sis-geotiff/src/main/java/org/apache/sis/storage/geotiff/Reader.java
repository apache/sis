/**
 * An image reader for GeoTIFF files. This reader duplicates the implementations performed by other libraries, but we
 * nevertheless provide our own reader in Apache SIS for better control on the process of decoding geospatial metadata.
 * We also measured better performance with this reader at least for uncompressed files, and added support for some
 * unusual data layout not supported by other libraries.
 *
 * <p>This image reader can also process <cite>Big TIFF</cite> images.</p>
 *
 * <p>The TIFF format specification version 6.0 (June 3, 1992) is available
 * <a href="https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/tiff/TIFF6.pdf">here</a>.</p>
