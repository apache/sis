/**
 * The API used internally by Apache SIS for fetching all data from netCDF files.
 * We use this API for isolating Apache SIS from the library used for reading the
 * netCDF file: it can be either the UCAR library, or our own internal library.
 *
 * <p>We do not use systematically the UCAR library because it is quite large (especially when including
 * all dependencies) while SIS uses only a fraction of it. This is because the UCAR library provides some
 * features like referencing services which overlap with SIS services. In addition, SIS often needs "raw"
 * data instead of "high level" data. For example we need the minimal and maximal values of a variable in
 * its raw format, while the UCAR high level API provides the values converted by the offset and scale
 * factors.</p>
 *
 * <p>A side effect of this isolation layer is also to adapt netCDF vocabulary to Apache SIS one.
 * For example what netCDF calls <cite>"coordinate system"</cite> is actually a mix of what OGC/ISO
 * specifications call <cite>"coordinate system"</cite>, <cite>"coordinate reference system"</cite>
 * and <cite>"grid geometry"</cite>. The netCDF coordinate system <cite>"range"</cite> is closer to
 * ISO 19123 <cite>"domain"</cite>, the netCDF coordinate system <cite>"domain"</cite> is closer to
 * ISO 19123 <cite>"grid envelope"</cite> and the ISO 19123 <cite>"range"</cite> is rather related
 * to the netCDF variable minimum and maximum values. Trying to use OGC/ISO and netCDF objects in
 * the same code appears to be <strong>very</strong> confusing. This isolation layer allows our code
 * to use a more consistent vocabulary (compared to the rest of Apache SIS).</p>
