/**
 * Adds the missing methods in {@code ChannelDataOutput} for implementing the {@code DataOutput} interface.
 * Current implementation does not yet implements the {@code ImageOutputStream} sub-interface, but a future
 * implementation may do so.
 *
 * <p>We do not implement {@link ImageOutputStream} yet because the later inherits all read operations from
 * {@code ImageInputStream}, while the {@code org.apache.sis.internal.storage} package keeps the concerns
 * separated. Despite that, the name of this {@code ChannelImageOutputStream} anticipates a future version
 * which would implement the image I/O interface.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code DataOutput} methods are defined in this separated class rather than in the parent class
 * because some methods are Java 1.0 legacy and should be avoided (e.g. {@link #writeBytes(String)}).</p>
