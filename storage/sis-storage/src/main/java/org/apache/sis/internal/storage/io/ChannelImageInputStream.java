/**
 * Adds the missing methods in {@code ChannelDataInput} for implementing the {@code ImageInputStream} interface.
 * The JDK approach for creating an image input stream from a channel would be as below:
 *
 * {@preformat java
 *     ReadableByteChannel channel = ...;
 *     ImageInputStream stream = ImageIO.createImageInputStream(Channels.newInputStream(channel));
 * }
 *
 * However the standard {@link javax.imageio.stream.ImageInputStreamImpl} implementation performs many work by itself,
 * including supporting various {@linkplain ByteOrder byte order}, which could be more efficiently done by NIO.
 * Furthermore, this class allows us to reuse an existing buffer (especially direct buffer, which are costly to create)
 * and allow subclasses to store additional information, for example the file path.
 *
 * <p>This class is used when compatibility with {@link javax.imageio.ImageReader} is needed.</p>
