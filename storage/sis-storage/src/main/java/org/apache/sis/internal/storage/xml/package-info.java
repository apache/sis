/**
 * {@link org.apache.sis.storage.DataStore} implementation for XML files that can be (un)marshalled by the
 * {@link org.apache.sis.xml.XML} class. The kind of objects recognized by this package is listed in the
 * {@link org.apache.sis.internal.storage.xml.Store} class.
 *
 * <p>This base package is designed for use with JAXB, which allows this package to be very small since most of the
 * XML (un)marshalling rules are specified in external classes designed for use with JAXB. However some classes can
 * also be used in other contexts. In particular, the {@link org.apache.sis.internal.storage.xml.stream} package in
 * the {@code sis-xmlstore} module extends this package with classes designed for use with StAX cursor API.</p>
