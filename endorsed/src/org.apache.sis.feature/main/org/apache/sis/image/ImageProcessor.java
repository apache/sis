/**
 * A predefined set of operations on images.
 * After instantiation, {@code ImageProcessor} can be configured for the following aspects:
 *
 * <ul class="verbose">
 *   <li>
 *     {@linkplain #setImageLayout(ImageLayout) Preferences about the tiling}
 *     of an image in relationship with a given image size.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setInterpolation(Interpolation) Interpolation method} to use during resampling operations.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setFillValues(Number...) Fill values} to use for pixels that cannot be computed.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setColorizer(Colorizer) Colorization algorithm} to apply for colorizing a computed image.
 *   </li><li>
 *     {@linkplain #setPositionalAccuracyHints(Quantity...) Positional accuracy hints}
 *     for enabling the use of faster algorithm when a lower accuracy is acceptable.
 *   </li><li>
 *     Whether operations can be executed in parallel. By default operations on unknown
 *     {@link RenderedImage} implementations are executed sequentially in the caller thread, for safety reasons.
 *     Some operations can be parallelized, but it should be enabled only if the {@link RenderedImage} is known
 *     to be thread-safe and has concurrent (or fast) implementation of {@link RenderedImage#getTile(int, int)}.
 *     Apache SIS implementations of {@link RenderedImage} can be parallelized, but it may not be the case of
 *     images from other libraries.
 *   </li><li>
 *     Whether the operations should fail if an exception is thrown while processing a tile.
 *     By default errors during calculation are propagated as an {@link ImagingOpException},
 *     in which case no result is available. But errors can also be notified as a {@link LogRecord} instead,
 *     in which case partial results may be available.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * For each image operations, above properties are combined with parameters given to the operation method.
 * Each method in this {@code ImageProcessor} class documents the properties used in addition of method parameters.
 *
 * <h2>API design</h2>
 * Properties (setter methods) are used for values that can be applied unchanged on many different images.
 * For example, the {@linkplain #getInterpolation() interpolation method} can be specified once and used
 * unchanged for many {@link #resample resample(…)} operations.
 * On the other hand, method arguments are used for values that are usually specific to the image to process.
 * For example, the {@link MathTransform} argument given to the {@link #resample resample(…)} operation depends
 * tightly on the source image and destination bounds (also given in arguments); those information usually need
 * to be recomputed for each image.
 *
 * <h2>Deferred calculations</h2>
 * Methods in this class may compute the result at some later time after the method returned, instead of computing
 * the result immediately on method call. Consequently, unless otherwise specified, {@link RenderedImage} arguments
 * should be <em>stable</em>, i.e. pixel values should not be modified after method return.
 *
 * <h2>Area of interest</h2>
 * Some operations accept an optional <var>area of interest</var> argument specified as a {@link Shape} instance in
 * pixel coordinates. If a shape is given, it should not be modified after {@code ImageProcessor} method call because
 * the given object may be retained directly (i.e. the {@code Shape} is not always cloned; it depends on its class).
 * In addition, the {@code Shape} implementation shall be thread-safe (assuming its state stay unmodified)
 * unless the execution mode is set to {@link Mode#PARALLEL}.
 *
 * <h2>Error handling</h2>
 * If an exception occurs during the computation of a tile, then the {@code ImageProcessor} behavior
 * is controlled by the {@link #getErrorHandler() errorHandler} property:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If {@link ErrorHandler#THROW}, the exception is wrapped in an {@link ImagingOpException} and thrown.</li>
 *   <li>If {@link ErrorHandler#LOG}, the exception is logged and a partial result is returned.</li>
 *   <li>If any other value, the exception is wrapped in a {@link LogRecord} and sent to that filter.
 *     The filter can store the log record, for example for showing later in a graphical user interface (GUI).
 *     If the filter returns {@code true}, the log record is also logged, otherwise it is silently discarded.
 *     In both cases a partial result is returned.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Thread-safety</h2>
 * {@code ImageProcessor} is safe for concurrent use in multi-threading environment.
 * Note however that {@code ImageProcessor} instances are mutable;
 * consider {@linkplain #clone() cloning} if setter methods are invoked on a shared instance.

     * is conceptually a simple linear transform (a scale and an offset) applied on sample values before they are
     * mapped to their colors.
     *
     * <p>The minimum and maximum value can be either specified explicitly,

     * may still appear much further. The minimum and maximum values alone are not a robust way to compute a range of
     * values for the color ramp because a single value very far from other values is sufficient for making the colors
     * difficult to distinguish for 99.9% of the data.</p>
     *
     * <p>The range of values for the color ramp can be narrowed with following modifiers
     * (a {@link Map} is used for allowing addition of more modifiers in future Apache SIS versions).
     * All unrecognized modifiers are silently ignored. If no modifier is specified, then the color ramp

     *
     * <h4>How to specify colors</h4>
     * The image colors can be controlled by the {@link Colorizer} set on this image processor.
     * It is possible to {@linkplain Colorizer#forInstance(ColorModel) specify explicitly} the
     * {@link ColorModel} to use, but this approach is unsafe because it depends on the pixel values
     * <em>after</em> their conversion to the visualization image, which is implementation dependent.
     * A safer approach is to define colors relative to pixel values <em>before</em> their conversions.
     * It can be done in two ways, depending on whether the {@value PlanarImage#SAMPLE_DIMENSIONS_KEY}
     * image property is defined or not.
     * Those two ways are described in next sections and can be combined in a chain of fallbacks.
     * For example the following colorizer will choose colors based on sample dimensions if available,
     * or fallback on predefined ranges of pixel values otherwise:
     *
     * {@snippet lang="java" :
     *     Function<Category,Color[]>  flexible   = ...;
     *     Map<NumberRange<?>,Color[]> predefined = ...;
     *     processor.setColorizer(Colorizer.forCategories(flexible)     // Preferred way.
     *                    .orElse(Colorizer.forRanges(predefined)));    // Fallback.
     *     }
     *
     * <h5>Specifying colors for ranges of pixel values</h5>
     * When no {@link SampleDimension} information is available, the recommended way to specify colors is like below.
     * In this example, <var>min</var> and <var>max</var> are minimum and maximum values
     * (inclusive in this example, but they could be exclusive as well) in the <em>source</em> image.
     * Those extrema can be floating point values. This example specifies only one range of values,
     * but arbitrary numbers of non-overlapping ranges are allowed.
     *
     * {@snippet lang="java" :
     *     NumberRange<?> range = NumberRange.create(min, true, max, true);
     *     Color[] colors = {Color.BLUE, Color.MAGENTA, Color.RED};
     *     processor.setColorizer(Colorizer.forRanges(Map.of(range, colors)));
     *     RenderedImage visualization = processor.visualize(source, null);
     *     }
     *
     * The map given to the colorizer specifies the colors to use for different ranges of values in the source image.
     * The ranges of values in the returned image may not be the same; this method is free to rescale them.
     * The {@link Color} arrays may have any length; colors will be interpolated as needed for fitting
     * the ranges of values in the destination image.
     *
     * <h5>Specifying colors for sample dimension categories</h5>
     * If {@link SampleDimension} information is available, a more flexible way to specify colors
     * is to associate colors to category names instead of predetermined ranges of pixel values.
     * The ranges will be inferred indirectly, {@linkplain Category#getSampleRange() from the categories}
     * themselves {@linkplain SampleDimension#getCategories() encapsulated in sample dimensions}.
     * The colors are determined by a function receiving {@link Category} inputs.
     *
     * {@snippet lang="java" :
     *     Map<String,Color[]> colors = Map.of(
     *         "Temperature", new Color[] {Color.BLUE, Color.MAGENTA, Color.RED},
     *         "Wind speed",  new Color[] {Color.GREEN, Color.CYAN, Color.BLUE});
     *
     *     processor.setColorizer(Colorizer.forCategories((category) ->
     *         colors.get(category.getName().toString(Locale.ENGLISH))));
     *
     *     RenderedImage visualization = processor.visualize(source, ranges);
     *     }
     *
     * This separation makes easier to apply colors based on criterion other than numerical values.
     * For example, colors could be determined from {@linkplain Category#getName() category name} such as "Temperature",
     * or {@linkplain org.apache.sis.measure.MeasurementRange#unit() units of measurement}.
     * The {@link Color} arrays may have any length; colors will be interpolated as needed for fitting
     * the ranges of values in the destination image.
