AssumeUnsigned                    = Assume database byte/tinyint unsigned, due to a lack of metadata.
CanNotAnalyzeFully                = Cannot analyze fully the database schema because of incomplete metadata.
CanNotBuildSQL                    = Error while building the SQL query. Fallback partially on pure Java implementation.
CanNotFetchCRS_1                  = Cannot fetch a Coordinate Reference System (CRS) for SRID code {0}.
CanNotFindSRID_1                  = Cannot find an identifier in the database for the reference system \u201c{0}\u201d.
DataSource                        = Provider of connections to the database.
DuplicatedColumn_1                = Unexpected duplication of column named \u201c{0}\u201d.
DuplicatedSRID_2                  = Spatial Reference Identifier (SRID) {1} has more than one entry in \u201c{0}\u201d table.
IllegalQualifiedName_1            = \u201c{0}\u201d is not a valid qualified name for a table.
IncompatibleLiteralCRS_2          = The literal of function \u201c{0}\u201d is not compatible with the reference system of property \u201c{1}\u201d.

SpatialExtensionNotFound_1        = The {0} spatial extension is not found.
UnexpectedTypeForSRID_2           = SRID {1} does not define a Coordinate Reference System. The object is a `{0}` instead.
