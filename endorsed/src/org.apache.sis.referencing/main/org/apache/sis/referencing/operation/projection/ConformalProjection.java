/**
 * Base class of {@link LambertConicConformal}, {@link Mercator} and {@link PolarStereographic} projections.
 * Those projections have in common the property of being <dfn>conformal</dfn>, i.e. they preserve angles locally.
 * However, we do not put this base class in public API because not all conformal projections extend this base class.
 * For example, the {@link TransverseMercator} projection, despite being conformal, uses very different formulas.
 *
 * <p>Note that no projection can be both conformal and equal-area. So the formulas in this class are usually
 * mutually exclusive with formulas in {@link AuthalicConversion} class (used for equal-area projections).</p>
 *
 * <p>This base class can be seen as a generalization of <cite>Lambert Conic Conformal</cite> projection,
 * which includes some other projections like Mercator and Polar Stereographic as special cases.
 * For this base class, the Mercator projection is considered as <q>a special limiting case of the
 * Lambert Conic Conformal map projection with the equator as the single standard parallel.</q>
 * (Source: §1.3.3 in IOGP Publication 373-7-2 – Geomatics Guidance Note number 7, part 2 – April 2015).
 * Indeed, those two projections have some equation in commons which are provided in this base class.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Polar Stereographic projection is not documented as a special case of Lambert Conic Conformal,
 * but the equations in the {@code PolarStereographic.transform(…)} and {@code inverseTransform(…)} methods
 * appear to be the same with the <var>n</var> factor fixed to 1 or -1, so we leverage the code provided by
 * this base class. This class hierarchy is only an implementation convenience and not part of public API.</p>
 *
 * <p>The Transverse Mercator projection is also conformal, but does not use the formulas provided in this class.
 * It will instead compute the coefficients itself and use its own, more complex, formulas with those coefficients.
 * However, the formulas provided in this {@code ConformalProjection} class can be seen as a special case of
 * Transverse Mercator formulas for <var>x</var> = 0.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Reference</h2>
 * “Lambert developed the regular Conformal Conic as the oblique aspect of a family containing the previously
 * known polar Stereographic and regular Mercator projections. (…) If the standard parallels are symmetrical
 * about the Equator, the regular Mercator results (although formulas must be revised). If the only standard
 * parallel is a pole, the polar Stereographic results.” (Snyder, page 105).

     * Lambert projection with the equator as the single standard parallel.
     *

     * by this method. The <em>reciprocal</em> of this function {@code 1/expΨ(φ)} is the converse of {@link #φ(double)}.

     * Gudermannian function. There is many representations of that function, e.g. {@literal gd(Ψ) = 2⋅atan(expΨ) - π/2}.</p>
     *
     * <p>In IOGP Publication 373-7-2 – Geomatics Guidance Note number 7, part 2 – April 2015,
     * a function closely related to this method has the letter <var>t</var>.</p>
     *
     *
     * <h4>Properties</h4>
     * This function is used with φ values in the [-π/2 … π/2] range and has a periodicity of 2π.
     * The result is always a positive number when the φ argument is inside the above-cited range.
     * If, after removal of any 2π periodicity, φ is still outside the [-π/2 … π/2] range, then the
     * result is a negative number. In a Mercator projection, such negative number will result in NaN.
     *
     * <p>Some values are:</p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>expΨ(NaN)    =  NaN</li>
     *   <li>expΨ(±∞)     =  NaN</li>
     *   <li>expΨ(-π/2)   =   0</li>
     *   <li>expΨ( 0  )   =   1</li>
     *   <li>expΨ(+π/2)   →   ∞  (actually some large value like 1.633E+16)</li>
     *   <li>expΨ(-φ)     =  1 / expΨ(φ)</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     *
     * <h4>The π/2 special case</h4>
     * The value at {@code Math.PI/2} is not exactly infinity because there is no exact representation of π/2.
     * However, since the conversion of 90° to radians gives {@code Math.PI/2}, we can presume that the user was
     * expecting infinity. The caller should check for the PI/2 special case himself if desired, as this method
     * does nothing special about it.
     *
     * <p>Note that the result for the φ value after {@code Math.PI/2} (as given by {@link Math#nextUp(double)})
     * is still positive, maybe because {@literal PI/2 < π/2 < nextUp(PI/2)}. Only the {@code nextUp(nextUp(PI/2))}
     * value become negative. Callers may need to take this behavior in account: special check for {@code Math.PI/2}
     * is not sufficient, the check needs to include at least the {@code nextUp(Math.PI/2)} case.</p>
     *
     *
     * <h4>Relationship with Snyder</h4>
     * This function is related to the following functions from Snyder:
     *
     * <ul>
     *   <li>(7-7) in the <cite>Mercator projection</cite> chapter.</li>
     *   <li>Reciprocal of (9-13) in the <cite>Oblique Mercator projection</cite> chapter.</li>
     *   <li>Reciprocal of (15-9) in the <cite>Lambert Conformal Conic projection</cite> chapter.</li>
     * </ul>
