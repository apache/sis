/**
 * Swing widgets for some visual verifications. This is used for debugging purposes only.
 * The visualization tools in this package are not related to any particular SIS objects.
 * This package may seem unused by code on the repository because it is often used only
 * temporarily during debugging phase.
 *
 * <h2>Other visualization tools</h2>
 * This package does not contains all visualization tools. Some debugging tools specific
 * to a particular class are provided in the package of that class. Examples:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.sis.referencing.internal.shared.ShapeUtilitiesViewer}</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.sis.referencing.gazetteer.LocationViewer}</li>
 *   <li>{@link org.apache.sis.image.ImageTestCase}</li>
