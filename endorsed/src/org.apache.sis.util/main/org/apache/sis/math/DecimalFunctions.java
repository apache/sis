     * <h4>Use case</h4>

     * to centimetres is defined as exactly 2.54 cm/inch. This is by an internationally accepted definition
     * since 1959, not an approximation. But the 2.54 value cannot be represented exactly in the IEEE 754
     * format – the error is approximately 3.6E-17 cm/inch. In the vast majority of cases such tiny error
     * can be ignored. But in situations where it is desirable to have an error estimation
     * (e.g. in non-linear equations where errors can grow exponentially), this method can be useful.
     * Other examples of values defined in base 10 are conversions from feet to metres and
     * map projection parameters defined by national mapping agencies.
     *
     * <h4>Domain of validity</h4>
     * The current implementation cannot compute delta for {@code abs(value) < 3E-8} approximately,
     * except for the 0 value which is supported. For any non-zero value closer to zero than the 3E-8
     * threshold, this method returns {@code NaN} because of insufficient algorithm accuracy.
     * This limitation may change in any future SIS version if we find a better algorithm.
     *
     * @param  value  the value for which to get the delta compared to its base 10 representation.
     * @return the delta that would need to be added to the given {@code double} value for getting a result
     *         closer to its base 10 representation, or {@link Double#NaN NaN} if it cannot be computed.
